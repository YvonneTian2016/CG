**********************************Run Instructions***************************
1.Soft Shadow
  Using the 03_plane.json to run directly, you will see the soft shadow feature results.In the “raytrace_ray” method, you can change the variable num_sample, which means the number of samples you want to implement. Now the value is 500. You can change it to different value and see the different soft shadow results.

2.Texture Tilling
  Firstly, you need to choose a picture you want to use it as the texture.And add “kd_txt” to the material volume in the json file of the scene. We now use the smile.png to be the texture and have added it in the 02_quad.json file. And then set input parameter tile of method “lookup_scaled_texture” to be true.Then run the 02_quad.json, you will get the tilling result. 
And if you want to change the tilling range,you could just change the variable range in the intersect.h file.

3.Projective Texture Mapping
  Similar with the Texture Tilling, you need to choose a picture to be the texture. And add ”kd_txt” to the material volume in the json file of the scene. We now use the worldmap.png to be the texture and have added it in the 03_plane.json file. And then set input parameter tile of method ”lookup_scaled_texture” to be false. Then run the 03_plane.json, you will get  mapping result.

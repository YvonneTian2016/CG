I have completed all the requirements of this assignment, and put all the results in the scenes folder. They are same as the referenced images in the scenes folder.

Because there are no function framework of the 6 Displacement Mapping, I added the code of this function in Sphere Subdivision method. To control this part of program, I added a bool variable in the Surface struct at scene.h, which is Displacement_Mapping. 

If you want to test the function of Displacement Mapping, please set “true” to this variable. Run the 03_subdivquads.json again, you will have the output of Displacement_Mapping as I have put in scenes folder(“Displacement Mapping of quads.png”), which used the “images.png” in the scenes folder as my input png.

And if you want to check the code of this function, please check the Sphere Subdivision method.These code have been annotated with “edited by Yuan Tian for Displacement Mapping”.
